        DS-19: Write a function that validates that a Binary Search Tree or sub-tree is a valid BST (that is, follows the rules of a BST):
        No modifications to the tree are allowed. The tree can be arbitrarily large; however the depth is guaranteed to be less than 2^10

        Rules of BST:
        All of the nodes with values less than the root are on the left side of the tree, and all of the nodes with values greater than the root are on the right.
